## üîß Before You Start - Required Software

You need to install these programs on your computer **before** setting up the application:

### 1. Git (for downloading the application)
- **Windows**: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
- **Mac**: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/mac  
- **Linux**: Run `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install git` (CentOS)

### 2. Docker Desktop (for running the application)
- **Windows**: Download from https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe
- **Mac**: Download from https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg
- **Linux**: Follow instructions at https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/

**Important**: After installing Docker Desktop, make sure it's running (you should see the Docker whale icon in your system tray).

### 3. PowerShell (Windows only)
- Windows 10/11 already has PowerShell installed
- For older Windows versions, download from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell

## üì• Getting the Application from GitHub

### Step 1: Open Terminal/Command Prompt
- **Windows**: Press `Windows key + R`, type `powershell`, press Enter
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

### Step 2: Choose a location for the application
Navigate to where you want to store the application (e.g., your Desktop):

```bash
# For Windows
cd Desktop

# For Mac/Linux  
cd ~/Desktop
```

### Step 3: Download the application
Copy and paste this command exactly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djordje882/multi-agent-project.git
```

This will create a folder called `multi-agent-project` with all the application files.

### Step 4: Enter the application folder
```bash
cd multi-agent-project
```

## üöÄ Setting Up the Application

You have two options for starting the application:

### Option 1: Fast Startup (Recommended)
This automatically sets up everything for you.

**Windows users:**
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

**Mac/Linux users:**
```bash
chmod +x setup.ps1
./setup.ps1
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a secure database with default settings
- Starts all application services
- Sets up sample roles for construction workers
- Takes about 2-3 minutes to complete

### Option 2: Manual Setup (For Advanced Users)
If you prefer to control each step:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**What this does:**
- Builds the application from source code
- Starts the database, backend API, and frontend interface
- Takes about 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed

## üåê Accessing the Application

Once setup is complete, open your web browser and go to:

**Main Application:** http://localhost:3002

**API Documentation:** http://localhost:8002/docs (for developers)

**Note**: The first time you load the application, there might be a brief delay (5-10 seconds) while the database initializes. This is normal.

## üìö How to Use the Application

### 1. Managing Roles
- Go to the "Roles" section
- Add job positions like "Mason", "Site Manager", "Carpenter", etc.
- These roles will be used when creating employees

### 2. Managing Construction Sites  
- Go to the "Sites" section
- Add your work locations with names and addresses
- Examples: "Downtown Office Building", "Highway Bridge Project"

### 3. Managing Employees
- Go to the "Employees" section
- Click "Add Employee" 
- Fill in: Name, Last Name, Role, Construction Site, Hourly Rate
- The hourly rate should be in your local currency (e.g., 25.00 for $25/hour)

### 4. Time Tracking
- Go to the "Timesheet" section
- Select an employee and date range
- Record time entries:
  - **Punch In/Out**: For regular work hours
  - **Sick**: For sick leave (counts as 8 hours at full pay)
  - **Vacation**: For vacation time (counts as 8 hours at full pay)

### 5. Generating Payroll
- Go to the "Timesheet" section
- Select employee and pay period dates
- Click "Generate PDF" to create a payroll report
- The system automatically calculates pay based on time worked and rates

## üí∞ Understanding Payroll Calculations

The application uses these pay rate multipliers:

| Time Type | Pay Rate | Example (if hourly rate is $20) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Regular Hours (1-8 hours/day) | 100% | $20.00/hour |
| Overtime (over 8 hours/day) | 115% | $23.00/hour |
| Weekend Work (Saturday/Sunday) | 150% | $30.00/hour |
| Holiday Work (Sundays) | 200% | $40.00/hour |
| Sick Leave | 100% | $20.00/hour (8 hours) |
| Vacation | 100% | $20.00/hour (8 hours) |

**Example Calculation:**
If an employee works:
- 8 regular hours: 8 √ó $20 = $160
- 2 overtime hours: 2 √ó $23 = $46
- **Total**: $206 for the day

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Cannot connect to Docker" error
**Solution**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running. Look for the Docker whale icon in your system tray. If it's not there, start Docker Desktop from your applications.

### "Port already in use" error  
**Solution**: Stop the application and restart:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Application won't load in browser
**Solutions**:
1. Wait 30 seconds after startup for initialization to complete
2. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check that you're using the correct URL: http://localhost:3002
4. Make sure no other applications are using ports 3002, 8002, or 5437

### "Permission denied" error on Mac/Linux
**Solution**: Make the setup script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup.ps1
```

### Database connection errors
**Solution**: Reset the database:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Application is slow or unresponsive
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you have at least 4GB of free RAM
2. Close other applications to free up memory
3. Restart Docker Desktop
4. Restart the application: `docker-compose restart`
